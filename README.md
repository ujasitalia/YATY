# YATY

Built an end-to-end digital crowdfunding platform for students to create campaigns and share them on social media where people can
directly donate to their campaign using the platform.
Implemented PayU payment gateway to provide robust and secure money transfers and the platform is secured with two-factor
authentication using Firebase Authentication. Campaigns and the user data is stored securely using Firebase Realtime Database.
